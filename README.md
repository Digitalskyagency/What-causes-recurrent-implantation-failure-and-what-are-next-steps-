# What-causes-recurrent-implantation-failure-and-what-are-next-steps-

Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is typically defined as multiple failed transfers of good-quality embryos. Causes are multifactorial: embryonic aneuploidy, uterine anatomical issues (polyps, fibroids, adhesions), endometrial receptivity problems, immunologic or thrombophilic factors, chronic endometritis, or sperm/embryo quality issues. Next steps usually include a stepwise evaluation â€” review embryo genetics (consider PGT-A), comprehensive uterine imaging (sonography, hysteroscopy), endometrial biopsy to rule out chronic endometritis, and targeted medical therapies if indicated. In some cases, changing embryo stage (day-5 vs day-3), transfer technique, or using endometrial receptivity assays may be discussed. Emotional support and realistic counseling are important while investigations proceed. Work closely with your clinic to design a focused plan.
